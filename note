For a time-independent hamiltonian $\hat{H}$, the formal solution of the Schrödinger equation can be written in terms of the time-evolution operator $\hat{U}(t,t_0)$ and a reference time $t_0$:

\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi(t)}=\hat{U}(t,t_0)\ket{\psi(t_0)}
    \label{state_time_evolution}
\end{equation}
